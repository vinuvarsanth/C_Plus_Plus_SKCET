Hanging Bridge
At the annual "KrackerJack Karnival", there was a newest attraction ever in the City, the "Hanging Bridge". Visitors will be able to walk 200ft on the bridge, hanging around 50ft above the ground, and enjoy a wide-angle view of the breathtaking greenery.
The Hanging Bridge was inaugurated successfully in co-ordination with the Event Manager Rahul. There is a limit on the maximum number of people on the bridge and Rahul has to now ensure the count of people on the bridge currently should not exceed the limit. He then approximately estimated that C adults and D kids who came to the show, were on the hanging bridge. He also noticed that there are L legs of the people touching the bridge.
Rahul knows that kids love to ride on the adults and they might ride on the adults, and their legs won't touch the ground and hence he would miss counting their legs. Also Rahul knew that the adults would be strong enough to ride at max two kids on their back.
Rahul is now wondering whether he counted the legs properly or not. Specifically, he is wondering is there some possibility of his counting being correct. Please help Rahul in finding it.
Input format :
The only line of input contains three space separated integers C, D, L denoting number of the adults, number of the kids and number of legs of people counted by Rahul, respectively.
Output format :
Output a single line containing a string "yes" or "no" (both without quotes) according to the situation.
Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.
Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
1 1 4
Output 1 :
yes
Input 2 :
2 4 16
Output 2 :
no

Kalai has started an Event Management Company named “City Events and Decors”. The focus of this venture is to provide event management solutions for both personal functions and private parties, Organize and manage corporate events that leave a lasting impression and project your perfection.
In order to get herself equipped with the event management skills, she is organizing an Evening Party everyday in the first month. She booked a popular hall named “GRG Mahal” that could accommodate around 1000 people. She expected more crowd to this party during week ends and so she conducted the week end parties in the GRG Open Ground. After a month, she has to submit a report to the Board of Directors on how succesful these parties were. 
A week day party is considered to be succesful if the number of people attending this party is between 700 and 1000, both inclusive. A weekend party is considered to be successful if the number of people attending the party is at least 1500.
Can you please help Kalai in classifying whether the given parties were successful or not?
Given the day details and the number of people who have attended the party on that day, write a program to classify the party as successful or not.
Input format :
The first line of the input consists of a string that corresponds to the day details. The 7 days are denoted as “SUN”, “MON”, “TUE”, “WED”, “THU”, “FRI” and “SAT”.
Friday, Saturday and Sunday are considered to be week ends.
The second line of the input consists of an integer that corresponds to the number of people who have attended the party.
Output format :
Output consists of a string --- “Successful” or “Unsuccessful” or “Invalid Input”.
If the input string is not in one of the valid days or the if the input integer is negative, print Invalid Input.
Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.
Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
MON
800
Output 1 :

If all the 3 cards that the player picks are of the same type and same number, they get a Double Discount.
If all the 3 cards are of the same type or if they all have the same number, they get a Discount.
Otherwise, they do not get a Discount.
Alex has now picked 3 cards and is awaiting to know if he has got a Discount. Please help him to know if he has won the Discount or not.
Input format :
There are 3 lines of input.
Each of the lines consists of a character and integer input, which corresponds to the type of the card and the number in it that Alex picked. The type of card and the number are separated by a single space.

“DIWALI DAMAKKA” is the most successful event dedicated to children and families. The Event has more than 20 rides for children and adults and the organizers always ensure not to compromise on the safety of the visitors.
To ensure the safety of the rides, the organizers have graded the rides in the fair according to the following conditions:
Hurl Factor must be greater than 50.
Spin Factor must be greater than 60.
Speed factor must be greater than 100.
The grades are as follows:
Grade is 10 if all three conditions are met.
Grade is 9 if conditions (i) and (ii) are met.
Grade is 8 if conditions (ii) and (iii) are met.
Grade is 7 if conditions (i) and (iii) are met.
Garde is 6 if only one condition is met.
Grade is 5 if none of three conditions are met.
Write a program to display the grade of the rides, given the values of hurl factor, spin factor and speed factor of the ride under consideration.
Input format :
First line of the input consists of 3 integers that gives the Hurl Factor, Spin Factor and Speed Factor of the ride, each separated by a space.
Output format :
Output should display the grade of the ride depending on Conditions.
Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.
Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
51 89 150
Output 1 :
10
Input 2 :
45 69 102
Output 2 :
8

Sandy wants to design a body fat percentage calculation is as follows.
BF% = 64 − ( 20 * (height/waist) )
The list below comes from the American Council and shows the average percentages in specified groups.
Essential fat: 2–5%
Athletes: 6–13%
Fitness: 14-17%
Average: 18–24%
Obese: 25%+ 
Input format :
Height value and Waist value in the first line separated by space
Output format :
Body fat value along with group
(Refer sample outputs)
Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
120 40
Output 1 :
4.00 : Essential fat
Input 2 :
120 60
Output 2 :
24.00 : Average
Input 3 :
120 45.8
Output 3 :
11.60 : Athletes
Input 4 :
120.3 79.5
Output 4 :
33.74 : Obese
