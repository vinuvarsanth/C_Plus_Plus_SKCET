The prime functionality of an Event Management System is budgeting. An Event Management System should estimate the total expenses incurred by an event and the percentage rate of each of the expenses involved in planning and executing an event. Nikhil, the founder of "Pine Tree" wanted to include this functionality in his company’s Proton Event Management System and requested your help in writing a program for the same.
The program should get the branding expenses, travel expenses, food expenses, and logistics expenses as input from the user and calculate the total expenses for an event and the percentage rate of each of these expenses.
Input format :
The first input is a double value that corresponds to the branding expenses.
The second input is a double value that corresponds to the travel expenses.
The third input is a double value that corresponds to the food expenses.
The fourth input is a double value that corresponds to the logistics expenses.
Output format :
The first line of the output should display the double value that corresponds to the total expenses for the Event.
The next four lines should display the percentage rate of each of the expenses.
Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.
[All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output.]
Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
20000
40000
15000
25000
Output 1 :
Total expenses :Rs.100000.00
Branding expenses percentage : 20.00%
Travel expenses percentage : 40.00%
Food expenses percentage : 15.00%
Logistics expenses percentage : 25.00%

Problem Statement :
The newspaper Agency
Each Sunday, a newspaper agency sells w copies of a special edition newspaper for Rs.x per copy. The cost to the agency of each newspaper is Rs.y. The agency pays a fixed cost for storage, delivery, and so on of Rs.100 per Sunday. The newspaper agency wants to calculate the profit which it obtains only on Sundays. Can you please help them out by writing a program to compute the profit if w, x, and y are given?
Input format :
Input consists of 3 integers: w, x, and y. w is the number of copies sold, x is the cost per copy and y is the cost the agency spends per copy. 
Output format :
The output consists of a single integer which corresponds to the profit obtained by the newspaper agency.

Problem Statement :
Four musketeers
Dhoni joined the group of 3 Musketeers and now their group is called four Musketeers. Meanwhile, Dhoni also moved to a new house in the same locality nearby to the other three. Currently, the houses of Sachin, Dravid and Ganguly are located in the shape of a triangle. When the three musketeers asked Dhoni about the location of his house, he said that his house is equidistant from the houses of the other 3. Can you please help them find out the location of the house? Given the 3 locations {(a1,b1), (a2,b2) and (a3,b3)} of a triangle, write a program to determine the point which is equidistant from all the 3 points. 
Input format :
Input consists of 6 integers.
The first integer corresponds to a1.
The second integer corresponds to b1.
The third and fourth integers correspond to a2 and b2 respectively.
